# FS Tool

This is a Tampermonkey/GreaseMonkey script that adds extra functionality to make it easier to work on FamilySearch.org.

This is my own personal project is not based off FamilySearch source code or associated with FamilySearch in any way.

## Installation

1. [Install Tampermonkey](https://youtu.be/8tyjJD65zws) or Greasemonkey in your browser if you haven't already.
2. Click [here](https://github.com/matthewpwatkins/fs-army-knife/releases/latest/download/fs-army-knife.user.js) to install the latest version of the script.

That's it!

## Features

### Search for possible duplicates in the tree from the person view

FamilySearch already allows you to easily search for records within FamilySearch from within the person view. I've also added a button to search the tree for duplication people from the person view.

### Search the tree and other records from a record page

When you're viewing a record, you can search the tree for the person in the record, or search for other records for this person without manually typing in all the informatino yourself.

### Full-text search

Full-text search is an amazing tool, allowing you to search for text within microfilm, books, and other previously unsearchable imagesin FamilySearch. You must [enable full-text search on your account](https://www.familysearch.org/en/labs/) to use this feature. When you're viewing a record match, you will see a link to open the full-text search for that person's name in that record, saving you the work of hunting through images manually.

Or if you are already viewing a film or other record, you can access full-text search from the film details page:

### Go to FamilySearch directly from FindAGrave

If you're on FindAGrave memorial page, there are now a series of icons for each memorial that are fetched and cached in your browser when you load the page

- The page icon links to the corresponding FamilySearch record page for this FindAGrave memorial.
- The person icon links to the FamilySearch person that the record is attached to (if it is attached to a person and you logged into FamilySearch before visiting FindAGrave).
- The refresh icon allows you to fetch the latest information from FamilySearch for this record.

### Copy FamilySearch session ID

This is for the developers. It adds a menu item to Tampermonkey to copy your FamilySearch session ID to the clipboard so you don't have to grab it out of your cookies yourself.
